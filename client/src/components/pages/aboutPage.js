                    <h3>Rectify</h3>
                    <p>Rectify is a software development company that currently creates websites and applications. The company is a start up and was created in spring of 2020. Projects vary from front-end to back-end or even just helping clients start launching their company. Rectify clients include NFT start ups, Stock analysis, Merch stores, and stock and forex traders</p>
                    <h4>My Task:</h4>
                    <p>At Rectify my task was to build the client's desired systems or just help the client with completeing or building their projects. This included websites, apps, and api intergration. The clients allowed me to choose the tech if the project was from scratch and I'd give them a break down of the options. Some of the work already had the tech selected and I just had to help them accomplish their task. Tech I used are: React.js, Google Cloud platform, Firebase, Flask.py, Node.js, Html, Css, and Shopify. </p>
